## What is this?

It's an Express + Svelte app to enable the (forced) sharing of media reccomendations. Make your friends consume the media you love - it's great.

## What are the rules?

So here's the cheese: you're allowed to give your friend/family/significant other *one* media reccomendation. They *have* to complete it within that year. They can then make the same demand for one media from you (one media, finish by end of year).

It can be a book, movie, video game, album, youtube meme compilation - pretty much *anything* üòè (as long as it's reasonable to call it *media*) 

Example: I give my partner Life is Strange (the video game) and they give me Dune (the book). We have to finish the media within the year (media must be given by end of January and finished before January first the following year).

This app just gives an interface for that interaction üí¶
